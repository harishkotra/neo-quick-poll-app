## About the Project

This application demonstrates how blockchain can be used for community voting and decision-making. It's designed for testing decentralized governance models without using real assets. 

Key features:
- Create and participate in blockchain-based polls
- View real-time results powered by smart contracts
- Connect securely with MetaMask
- Built on NeoX T4 Testnet for safe experimentation

## Who Is This For?

Neo Quick Poll is great for:
- DAOs looking to test voting mechanisms
- Community projects wanting to involve members in decisions
- Blockchain enthusiasts interested in decentralized applications
- Anyone curious about how blockchain can be used for voting

## Technology Stack

We built Neo Quick Poll using:
- React for the user interface
- Ethers.js for blockchain interactions
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- NeoX T4 Testnet as the blockchain platform

## Getting Started

To run Neo Quick Poll locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/harishkotra/neo-quick-poll-app.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   cd neo-quick-poll-app
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

Note: You'll need MetaMask installed and connected to the NeoX T4 Testnet to use the application.

## How to Use

1. Connect your MetaMask wallet to the app
2. Create a new poll or vote on existing ones
3. Watch the results update in real-time

Remember, this is a testnet application. It's meant for experimentation and learning, not for making real-world decisions.
